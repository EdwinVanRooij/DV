    "Because my dataset is from the Reddit page /r/worldnews and I'm a regular Reddit visitor, the most frequent articles are not special to me. For this reason, I don't have a story yet and I'd like to base my story upon feedback to my visualization of the 2012-2014 trend received by others. Maybe they could find something shocking or unexpected in the trend that has been going on between 2012 and 2014 as described in my week 3 assignments. "
