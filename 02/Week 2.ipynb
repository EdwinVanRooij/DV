    "For this assignment I've chosen to really get into coding by myself, rather than using a tool with many predefined visualization tools such as Tableau. I like to be able to customize every bit of my software. For this exact reason, I've chosen to use the JavaScript library D3.js (and maybe http://dimplejs.org/ later on) to create my exloratory data visualizations. \n"

I've read about the first half of 'D3.js By Example' by Michael Heydt, while coding along with the examples. After that, I decided to continue onto the 'Data Visualization and D3.js' course on Udacity to really get familiar with the library. I now feel like I have a good grasp on the essentials, but with an enormous potential to become so much better at visualizing my data by learning more about D3.js, animations for example. \n"
